# Auto Steam Queue

## Idea

Initially, I made a fairly simple user script that "clicked" through a discovery queue as soon as the game's store page loaded. Soon after, many different users made suggestions and PRs to the script and it became a more well-rounded script. (Honestly, I hadn't anticipated such a reception so it's taken me awhile to actually get a proper GitHub repo up instead of some slapdash system I was using.)
